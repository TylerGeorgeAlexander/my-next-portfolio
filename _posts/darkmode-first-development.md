# DevDiscoveries - Exploring Dark Mode Development

## Have You Considered Dark Mode First Development?

Dark mode has become increasingly popular among users, and it's not just about mobile-first development anymore; it's also about considering dark mode from the very beginning of your application's creation. In this article, we'll discuss the importance of embracing dark mode in your development process.

### The Unexpected Challenge

When I embarked on creating a new application from scratch, everything seemed to be going smoothly until I viewed it on my iPhone. To my surprise, the HTML input elements appeared black, making them barely visible. This issue caught me off guard, and I only discovered it after deploying the application to Heroku and testing it on various devices using my phone.

It was clear that I needed to start thinking about both mobile and dark mode development simultaneously. To tackle this challenge and ensure a seamless user experience, I began researching solutions that would allow me to test dark mode live during the development phase.

### A Bright Solution

My quest for a solution led me to explore Google Chrome DevTools, where I stumbled upon a valuable feature tucked away in the Settings > More Tools > Rendering Tab.

Within the Rendering tab, I found the option to "Enable automatic dark mode," which I promptly checked.

Now I could see (or unable to see in this case *smile cry emoji* ðŸ˜‚ ) what so many potential users would experience when they have dark mode selected as a setting in their operating systems!

### Keyboard Shortcut for Convenience

Additionally, I discovered a handy keyboard shortcut for switching between dark and light modes within the developer tools. You can open the developer tools and press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P, then type "dark" or "light." Be sure to select the rendering options from the menu to switch the simulated dark/light mode without affecting the devtools' theme.

This shortcut opens a quick autocomplete search for panels, drawers, and all the features within DevTools, enhancing your development efficiency.

### Further Exploration

In summary / In conclusion, I've gained valuable insight into a feature that previously kept both me and my users in the dark. 

I hope I have opened your eyes to this issue as well, or at least potentially entertained you with *schadenfreude*.
