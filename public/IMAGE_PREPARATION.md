**Note: Image Preparation Process**

To maintain consistent image quality and aspect ratios across devices, I follow this image preparation process for images located within the public directory:

1. **Capture Screenshot**: Using Chrome Dev Tools, I capture a screenshot snippet at or around 800x600 pixels.

2. **Create New Project**: I utilize either [https://www.photopea.com/](https://www.photopea.com/) or Photoshop to create a new project with dimensions matching the captured screenshot (800x600 pixels).

3. **Paste and Center Align**: I paste the screenshot snippet into the new project and ensure it is centered and aligned within a transparent background.

4. **Export as PNG**: To save the image, I go to the "File" menu and select "Export as," ensuring that I choose the PNG format and verify that the dimensions are correctly set.

This method guarantees that all images are responsive and consistently captured at the same dimension, ensuring a uniform aspect ratio across various devices.
